My proposed web app concept

My proposed web app concept is a study assistant app that is specifically designed to help university students to help them plan their studies and task that they need to tackle. Help them to become more organised. Some key features would be implement a map API to show different study locations that they could go to, a calendar API where they can input different tasks and deadlines that they may have, and a more original feature that I want to add is an OpenAI personal assistant as I don't think many study web apps for students have that, so having that would make it more helpful and engaging for the student.

A web app that I am taking inspiration from would be "MyStudyLife". The part of the app that I will mostly be taking inspiration from is that layout, as I think it is clear and easy to understand, so I respect that that could be a good way that I could lay out my app, not to make a complete identical copy.

A way that it could use a database would be to store inputted small notes that the user wants to store onto the web app for specific topics that they are studying as well as log in/sign up details. Could also try and store all the sessions that the user have had with the openAI so they could go back and look at the information again.

For a novel user experience, I could try and use dynamic images, the addition of the OpenAI could be a big step in creating a brand-new experience for students as it will be implemented into the study web app.

The audience that I am trying to reach are students as this web app will help them the most when it comes to studying. The web app aligns with their needs because it comes with a built in calendar and map where they could put down their deadlines and tasks as well as a map to show them the different study locations within the area.
